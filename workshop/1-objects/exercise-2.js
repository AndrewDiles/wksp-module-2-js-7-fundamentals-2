// Exercise 2
// -------------------

const myKey = 'width';

const geometry = {
    length: 20,
    width: 30,
    height: 10,
    weight: 100
};

// There is an object above and a variable holding a key name. Use that variable
// to access and print the "width" value inside the object.

console.log(geometry[myKey]);

// Funny story, last weekend I wasted about 2 hours trying to figure out how to do this.
// I failed in my search, and I learned how from a friend ~.~
